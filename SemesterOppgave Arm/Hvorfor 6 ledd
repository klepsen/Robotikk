We have chosen to use 6 joints for our arm, because we want to two joints (first and last) to move i the yaw direction, 
and the remaining to move in pitch direction.
This means we will have 4 links in the pitch direction, which may be unnecessary, but the reason we want to keep this,
is because it will help us keep a smooth cartesian trajectory. It will also help us fold the arm better in resting
posistion.
